# LD42

Here be the files I (CJ Gladback) make for Ludum Dare 42, until my poor old computer has no more space.
Or, more likely, I decide that having not even a little bit prepared, I have better ways to spend this weekend.

I won't have much more time past the deadline for compo, so that is my goal: a solo game completely made in 48 hours.

Technically, much less than 48 hours because I was still at work when this started and then I messed around for the rest of the night.
Also, I'm trying a "new" (aka old and unpracticed) language for this: HTML5. The goal is either learning something or making something cool; if nothing works for the first day, I'll spend the rest of the weekend 3D modeling game assets.

Nothing wasted, nothing gained, right?
No. Nevermind. That's not a saying.
